# Stream Chat Integration Fixes for MingLee App

## Issues Fixed

1. **Backend Server Setup**
   - Added proper environment variable loading with dotenv
   - Created a proper package.json for the backend with all dependencies
   - Added a start-backend.bat script for easy server startup

2. **API URL Configuration**
   - Updated API_URL to use 10.0.2.2 instead of localhost for Android emulator compatibility
   - This ensures that the app can connect to your local backend server while running in an emulator

3. **Stream Chat Authentication**
   - Added proper error handling in the connectUser function
   - Added the session token to the API requests for authentication
   - Fixed type assertions in channel data setup to prevent TypeScript errors

4. **StreamChatWrapper Component**
   - Updated to properly initialize the Stream Chat client
   - Added proper Chat component integration with the provider hierarchy

## How to Test

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   ./start-backend.bat
   ```
   
2. Start the Expo app:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Login to the app and navigate to the Chat tab to see if messages load correctly

## Common Issues

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Backend Connection Issues**
   - Ensure your backend server is running on port 3000
   - Check the console for any API request errors
   - Verify that your Stream API key and secret are correct

2. **Authentication Problems**
   - Make sure the Appwrite session token is being saved to localStorage
   - Check that the auth middleware is working correctly

3. **Channel Creation Issues**
   - Check the console for any errors during channel creation
   - Ensure user IDs are being passed correctly
