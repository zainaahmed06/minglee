## Architecture

The chat system is built using the following components:

2. **Appwrite Authentication**: Integration with existing auth system
3. **React Native Components**: Custom UI components for chat interface
4. **Local Storage**: For offline message persistence

## Key Files

- `services/streamChat.ts`: Service for interacting with GetStream.io API
- `store/useChatContext.tsx`: Context provider for chat state management
- `components/ChatList.tsx`: UI component for displaying chat list
- `app/(tabs)/chat-conversation.tsx`: Screen for one-to-one chat conversations
- `store/useStreamChat.tsx`: Utility exports for Stream Chat components

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_STREAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url
```

## Backend Requirements

For the chat functionality to work properly, you'll need to set up:

1. A GetStream.io account and project
2. A backend endpoint that generates Stream Chat tokens
3. Stream webhook handlers for notifications

## Security Considerations

- Messages are only allowed between matched users
- All media files are stored securely
- Chat history is encrypted in transit
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent spam

## Future Enhancements
